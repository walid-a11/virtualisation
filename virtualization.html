    <h1>virtualization</h1>
    <p>In computing <strong>virtualization </strong>refers to the act of creating a virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of somthing. <br>
        This includes virtual computer hardware,virtual storage device and virtual network resources.</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
       <h1>Levels of virtualization </h1> 
       <ol>
        <li>  <h3>    1.virtualization at instruction set Architecrure (ISA) level</h3></li> 
       <p>          Every machine has an instruction set This instruction set is an interface between softwar and hardwar .Using this instruction software can <br>
                         communucat with hardwar </p>
       
      <li><h3>virtualization at operating system (O.S)level</h3></li> 
       <p> In virtualisation at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e by installing O.S application suites, network system ,<br>
          </p>
       
          <ul>
              <li>   In cloud sometimes,we need to initalize 100 Virtual machines as a single time,if we use virtualisation at HArdware abstraction layer <br>
                  (HAL) level this can take too much time.
              </li>
              <li>So,to overcome this in Virtualisation at Operating system between Virtual machines along  with the <br> hardware</li>
